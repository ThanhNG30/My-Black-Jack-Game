      Each card has a value on it. For example: 2,3,4,...,9,10 and J,Q,K also
      count as 10. Ace can be counted as 1 or 11, depends on the total value you
      already had.
      <br /><br />When the game starts, you will get 2 random cards. You can
      decide to Hit (draw more cards) or Stay (keep the cards you have) or
      Split. Split is only allowed when you have 2 cards with the same value.
      For example: 3 Spades and 3 Diamonds. Your cards will be splitted up into
      2 sets so you can play both hands for higher chance of winning. When you
      think you have won or lost, click Stay to reveal your cards and the
      Dealer's cards. The one that has the total closest to 21 win. <br /><br />
      1. If both people are not over 21, the higher one will win. <br />
      2. If you go bust (your total is over 21), you lose no matter what.<br />
      3. If the Dealer goes bust and you are not, then you win.
